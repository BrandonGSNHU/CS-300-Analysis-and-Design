# CS-300-Analysis-and-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
 
 Throughout this course I learned about different data structures, specifically vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Therefor, all of the problems surrounded these data structures and how to properly utilize them in real code. This proved difficult as I chose the one data structure I was weakest in, hash tables, for my final project. All in all it was very eye opening and fun to learn about

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  
  Data structures are an excellent way to store information. They are an efficent and effective way to access and edit information while saving on a substantial amount of memory. They make programming easier and the end result run smoother. 
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  When I encountered any road blocks I would spend a lot of time researching the information elsewhere whether that is a post or tutorial helping to shed some light on the subject. I would also reread the information given to me in zybooks over and over until I had a better grasp. For me, seeing the code and examples of it utilized help to connect the dots in my head for learning new material.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  I realize the value and importance of data structures now. This is an area that I need to get expertise in so I can improve my chances of having a successful career in the industry.
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  Organizing and using proper, clean, comments can make or break a program. Keeping everything in order and running efficiently is one sign of a good program. Data structures aid in this tremendously and are a subject I'll be returning to time and time again to master it.
